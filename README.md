# Fluence Aqua P2P Integration Challenge

Hello Browsers 3000 Hackers,

We are thrilled to participate with you in pushing the Web3 boundaries with the Browsers 3000 Fluence challenge.

## The Opportunity

Use Fluence's Aqua in the browser to compose a p2p solution integrating with IPFS. Examples of what we think pushes the limit include but aren't limited to creating browser-to-browser apps, additional p2p layers for faster content discovery, programming strategies for obtaining data from many peers, offloading content rendering to remote nodes or p2p-based real-time notification pipelines to the browser.

## The Prizes

USD 1,000 for the best overall solution and USD 100 for every submission that is a fully functional project using Fluence's Aqua to implement a decentralized workflow utilizing IPFS.

## The Judging
The grand prize winner is the highest chosen project by the Browsers 3000 Judges panel. The USD 100 prizes are contingent on the timely submissions of a functional project using Fluence's Aqua to implement a decentralized workflow utilizing IPFS.
